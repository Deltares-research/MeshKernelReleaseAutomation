# MeshKernelReleaseAutomation

This repository contains bash and python scripts for the release automation of MeshKernel and its related products.

## Preparation

### Conventions

release_number: <major>.<minor>.<patch>  
release_label: v<release_label>  
release_branch: release/<release_label>

### One-time setup

#### Prerequisite software

Install:

* wsl (or git bash on Windows, or use Linux directly â€“ the scripts are standard bash)
* git
* python
* miniconda
* gh (GitHub CLI)
* jq (JSON processor)

#### Access tokens

Get access tokens for:

* **TeamCity**  
   - Visit https://dpcbuild.deltares.nl/profile.html?item=accessTokens  
   - Create token  
   - Save the token in a file (ensure it contains only the token, no newline)

* **GitHub**  
   - Visit https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Generate a classic token with scopes: `repo`, `workflow`, `admin:org`.  
   - Save the token in a file
   - Authorize Deltares and Deltares-Research (under Configure SSO).   

* **PyPI**  
   - Create an account (save recovery codes).  
   - Enable 2FA with an authenticator.  
   - Create an API token with sufficient permissions to publish new releases.

* Clone the `MeshKernelReleaseAutomation` repository.

> **Important:** Before creating a release, ensure that **all TeamCity and GitHub pipelines are successful**. Any broken build will lead to release failure.

## Prepare for installing

Two scenarios are supported:
1. Release from `master`
2. Patch release from prepared patch release branches

### Release from master

Run the release script with the `--start_point master` option.

### Patch release

For each repository (MeshKernel, MeshKernelNET, MeshKernelPy, GridEditor_Plugin), create a release branch.

Cherry-pick additional commits (use `git cherry-pick -x <sha>` to mention the original commit sha in the commit message) where appropriate.

Push release branches to remote.

Run a release script with the `--start_point <release_branch>` option.

## Post-script checks

After the release script completes, perform the following checks:

### TeamCity
* MeshKernel  
  - pinned and tagged signed NuGet package
* MeshKernelNet  
  - pinned and tagged signed NuGet package
* GridEditor  
  - pinned and tagged D-Grid Editor Signed MSIs installer  
  - pinned and tagged signed NuGet package
* MeshKernelPy  
  - pinned and tagged Python wheel for Linux and Windows

### PyPI
* Verify that a new release is available on https://pypi.org/project/meshkernel/

### GitHub
* Verify that the desired release and tag have been created.
* Verify that all release assets were correctly uploaded.
* Ensure there are no open release pull requests on any repository.
* Verify that the release branch and tag have been merged back to main.

## Usage

It is assumed below that the release script is run from the root directory of the repository.

To display usage, run:

```bash
./scripts/automation/release.sh --help
```

Example usage:

```bash
./scripts/automation/release.sh \
    <--work_dir /path/to/work/dir> \
    <--version VERSION> \
    [--release_grid_editor_plugin] \
    <--start_point {main | master | latest | tag | branch | commit}> \
    [--auto_merge] \
    <--github_access_token GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN> \
    [--upload_to_pypi] \
    [--pypi_access_token PYPI_ACCESS_TOKEN] \
    <--teamcity_access_token TEAMCITY_ACCESS_TOKEN> \
    [--github_refresh_interval GITHUB_REFRESH_INTERVAL=30] \
    [--delay DELAY=30] \
